![Dexar Project Screenshot](ADD_YOUR_IMAGE_URL_HERE)

A static landing page for "Dexar," a conceptual car sales company. This project was my first complete website built after learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, with a focus on a desktop-first design.

The page features a modern design, a product showcase, and a separate login page template.
